# Contributing to DNHAPM
Thank you for your interest in the Danmakufu Application Monitoring System!

Bug reports should be raised on the Maidens of the Kaleidoscope Forum or preferably in GitHub Issues for the project. 
Bugs should preferably be labeled with [v#.#] where #.# is the latest version of the application that has the bug.

As for suggestions, please utilize the Suggestions and Feature Request labels for minor and major features, respectively. 
These too should go in GitHub Issues and should be properly formatted with the details of the suggestion or feature request.

In regards to pull requests, please provide a detailed description of the changes so that I can add any additional adjustments to other files that are needed.

Thank you very much.
